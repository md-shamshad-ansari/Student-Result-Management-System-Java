# Student-Result-Management-System-Java
Student Result Management System, a desktop application, is developed using JAVA SWING and MySQL server. 
This Project stores student details and their results. 
Here I used Java Swing to make the front end for the project, and in the backend, a database called MySQL is used. 
It is composed of two sections: administration and students.
In Admin Section Admin can add student, insert, delete and update result of students.
In Student Section student can see their result by entering valid roll number.
